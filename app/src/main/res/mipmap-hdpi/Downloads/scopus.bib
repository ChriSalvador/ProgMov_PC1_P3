	abstract = {The automotive and auto parts industries are important economic sectors in Thailand. With rapidly changing technology, every organization should understand what needs to be improved clearly, and shift their strategies to meet evolving consumer demands. The purpose of this research is to develop a Business Intelligence system for a brake pad manufacturing company in Thailand. By analyzing the relationship between market demand and supply components of the company through regression analysis and the principles of the marketing mix, we develop a product lifecycle curve for forecasting product sales. The developed system increases the workflow efficiency of the case study company, being able to simplify the traditional data preparation process that requires employees to collect and summarize data every time a request is made. An intelligence dashboard is subsequently created to help support decision-making, facilitate communication within the company, and eventually improve team efficiency and productivity. © 2023 by the authors.},
